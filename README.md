# P2P-piped-music
Background music played in retail stores and other public establishments. The idea is to develop a Web App to play music in a syncronized way (Similar to VirtualRoom project but music focused and without videocall of course). It could be useful not only for playing background music in stores, but also for playing foreground music in parties :)
